# About

Hey there, welcome to my site, I'm a rugby player who plays for the Austin Huns and who happens to be a developer as well.

I'm a rubyist but I also really like Go lang. I am not afraid of being a full stack developer and I am open to contributing to anything just click the little mail icon and reach out to me with any opportunities!

I've written some books and they can be found [here](https://amzn.eu/d/fLcNCvm)!
