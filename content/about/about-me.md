Hey there, welcome to my site, I'm a rugby player who plays for the Austin Huns and who happens to be a developer as well. I have previously written for [Medium](https://medium.com/@tedtke514), and have had some tech blogs published to Dev Genius, and Her Campus. However, I have decided to exclusively publish my thoughts on this site instead.

I'm a rubyist but I also really like Go lang. I am not afraid of being a full stack developer and I am open to contributing to anything just click the little mail icon and reach out to me with any opportunities!

I've written some books and they can be found [here](https://amzn.eu/d/fLcNCvm)!
